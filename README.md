I completed the following missing parts from the original code:
Implemented the Pulsar Pattern: Created the drawPulsar() function to generate a Pulsar pattern, which is a period-3 oscillator.


Implemented the PentaDecathlon Pattern: Added the drawPentaDecathlon() function to create a PentaDecathlon pattern, which is a period-15 oscillator.


Fixed the Button Handler: Corrected the event handler for the PentaDecathlon button, which was incorrectly calling drawGosperGliderGun() instead of drawPentaDecathlon().


Creative Improvements
I made the following enhancements to improve functionality and user experience:
Game Logic Improvements
Tracking Statistics: Added generation counter and population tracker to provide meaningful feedback about the simulation state.


Interactive Cell Toggling: Implemented the ability to click on cells to toggle their state, allowing for custom pattern creation.


Better Pattern Centering: Centered patterns on the grid for better visibility and to avoid edge effects.


Added Clear Grid Function: Implemented a proper grid clearing function that also resets statistics.


UI/UX Improvements
Step Button: Added a "Step" button to advance the simulation one generation at a time for better observation.


Spaceship Pattern: Added a new button and function to create a "Lightweight Spaceship" pattern.


Speed Control: Implemented a slider to adjust the simulation speed, with visual feedback of the current speed in milliseconds.


Improved Styling:


Added shadows to the canvas for better visual depth
Improved button styling with hover effects
Added a title and container layout
Improved font and color choices for better readability
Stats Display: Added a statistics section showing the current generation and population.


Technical Improvements
Code Organization: Improved the organization of the Game class by adding helper methods like clearGrid(), drawPattern(), and updatePopulation().


Canvas Interaction: Added event listeners to allow clicking on the canvas to toggle cell states.


Performance Optimization: Adjusted the simulation frame timing to be configurable rather than fixed at a very high frame rate.


Cleaner Patterns: Restructured the pattern drawing code to be more readable and maintainable.
